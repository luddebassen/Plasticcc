    <h1 class="main-header"> Why recycling is the solution to a lot of our problems </h1>
    <p class="recyclingtekst">
        We have multiple major short- and long term problems on our earth
        which we mainly have constructed ourselves. <br>
        Some of these problems are:
        <ul class="recyclingliste">
            <li> Global warming - and endangering animals</li>
            <li> Creating new diseases by littering and being unhygienic </li>
            <li> Increasing the difference between poor and wealthy </li>
            <li> Not helping those in need, both animals and humans </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="recyclingtekst">
        By recycling we can solve many of these problems! Recycling is strongly developed in already well developed countries, <br>
        but in less developed countries recycling is not a large priority. Often it is in these un-developed countries
        people <br>
        are in big need of clean water. These areas are also the ones where some of the worlds finest and most <br>
        precious wildlife abounds. Both in water and on land. Recycling here will lead to a better living for everyone. <br>
        On top of all these goods, our industries will have to use less energy and power to manufacture new material, <br>
        when we can re-use the old one already manufactured!
