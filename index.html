    <p class="recyclingtekst">
        The plastic valuta project is an idea formed to prevent and minimize plastic pollution on Earth. <br>
        The foundation of the idea is to build out recycling centers all over the world making it easily accessible for everyone. <br>
        This will give all citizens of cities and villages a local recycling center they can use. However, in order to make this <br>
        more attractive we want to make the plastic a valuable good. At the recycling center the citizens will be offered to trade <br>
        in plastic for a product of use. This product can be absolutely everything, for example food and clothes. This way people <br>
        can manage to take care of their family by gathering plastic and trading it in at the centers.
